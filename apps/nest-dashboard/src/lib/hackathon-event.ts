    question: "Can my team participate virtually?",
    answer:
      "Yes — fully. The hackathon runs virtually from June 7 to July 10, so you can build from anywhere in the world. You don't even need to register on Luma to take part virtually; only in-person finale attendance needs a ticket.",
  },
  {
    question: "When are submissions due?",
    answer:
      "All submissions are due Friday, July 10 at 12:00 PM (noon) ET — no matter where you're building from.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to come to MIT for the finale?",
    answer:
      "No. The Nanda Summit & finale on Saturday, July 11 at MIT Media Lab is optional, and attendance does not affect your score. There's no coding or building at the in-person event — only demos and meeting other builders.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens at the July 7 info session?",
    answer:
      "A free virtual webinar covering the hackathon format, participation options, project requirements, judging criteria, the timeline, and how to get started. Register on Luma to join.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do teams build?",
    answer:
      "Agentic AI applications in the Nanda Town sandbox using the SKILL.md framework — protocols and plugins across the twelve layers. Submit by opening a PR on GitHub with the branch name hackathon/<handle>-<theme>.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does judging work?",
    answer:
      "A judge panel scores each submission on correctness, realism, design, and docs. On July 11, judging runs 9:30 AM to noon to select the top 10 teams, with demos and sessions from 2 to 5 PM.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is hosting?",
    answer:
      "Project NANDA — Ramesh Raskar, Maria Gorskikh, and Vedh Krishnan — co-hosted by HCLTech and MIT Media Lab.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does everyone on my team need to register for July 11?",
    answer:
      "Only people attending in person. Each attending team member registers individually on Luma. Virtual teams can skip registration entirely.",
