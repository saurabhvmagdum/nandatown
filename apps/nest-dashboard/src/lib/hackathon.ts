/**
 * Server-only data loader for the /hackathon routes.
 *
 * Reads the static JSON written by `nest-marketplace-build` at the
 * repo root. The JSON shape is owned by `packages/nest-marketplace` —
 * keep `hackathon-types.ts` in sync with `nest_marketplace.adapter`.
 *
 * Why a static JSON instead of a request-time fetch?
 *
 * 1. Anonymous GitHub REST is rate-limited per-IP. A Railway deploy
 *    behind a shared egress will get 403'd within minutes if every
 *    page render touches `api.github.com`. Building once at deploy
 *    time keeps us well under the limit.
 * 2. The data is public and changes slowly (PRs land at human speed).
 *    Five-minute freshness is fine.
 * 3. Keeps secrets out: no token in the build, no token at runtime.
 *
 * This module imports `node:fs/promises` and is therefore not safe to
 * import from client components — the public surface is the types and
 * helpers in `./hackathon-types`.
