"""Real Ed25519 identity with key rotation and as-of historical verification.

Unlike :mod:`nest_plugins_reference.identity.did_key` (which simulates
public-key signatures with textbook RSA and is explicitly *not* production
cryptography), this plugin signs with **real Ed25519** keys via
``cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ed25519`` (RFC 8032).

Ed25519 is deterministic by construction — the per-signature nonce is derived
from the private key and the message, so the same key signing the same bytes
always yields identical signature bytes. That keeps Tier 1 traces
byte-for-byte reproducible without any explicit RNG handling, as long as the
private *seed* is derived deterministically. We derive each key's 32-byte seed
as ``sha256(seed || agent_id || rotation_index)`` and feed it to
``Ed25519PrivateKey.from_private_bytes``.

Key rotation
------------

A long-running agent must be able to rotate its signing key (compromise,
policy) without invalidating signatures it already made. Each key has a
validity window ``[issued_at_tick, rotated_out_tick)``. An agent keeps an
ordered list of :class:`KeyRecord` per peer. A signature made by an old key
still verifies **iff** verification is requested *as-of* a tick inside that old
key's window — see :meth:`Ed25519RotatingIdentity.verify`.

Rotation is a *publishing* operation: the new key is signed by the old key
(continuity-of-identity). :meth:`rotate_key` returns a :class:`RotationRecord`
whose ``continuity_signature`` proves the holder of the old key authorised the
new key. A verifier (or peer) checks that signature before trusting the new
key, so an attacker who only holds the *compromised old* key cannot mint a
*future* key unless they also already control the agent — and crucially the
old key's window is closed at rotation, so signatures it makes after rotation
fail an as-of check.

Two attacks this plugin defeats (and ``did_key`` does not):

1. **Post-rotation forgery** — an attacker who exfiltrated the old key forges a
   *fresh* signature after rotation. It carries the old ``key_id``; verified
   as-of the observation tick (after ``rotated_out``) it falls outside the old
   key's window → rejected.
2. **Backdating** — an attacker signs with the *new* key but claims the
   signature belongs in the old key's window. Verified as-of the old tick, the
   new key's window does not yet contain it → rejected. (The verifier never
   trusts a self-asserted timestamp; the as-of tick is supplied externally.)

Example::

    ident = Ed25519RotatingIdentity(AgentId("a1"), seed=b"seed")
    sig = ident.sign(b"hello")            # signed by key #0
    assert ident.verify(b"hello", sig, AgentId("a1"))
    rec = ident.rotate_key(b"new-seed")   # key #0 window closes, key #1 opens
    assert ident.verify_continuity(AgentId("a1"), rec)
