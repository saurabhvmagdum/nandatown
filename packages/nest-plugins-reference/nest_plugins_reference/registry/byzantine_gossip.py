"""Byzantine-resistant gossip registry plugin — scaffold (Task 1 of the series).

``nest_plugins_reference.registry.gossip.GossipRegistry`` gives us
eventually-consistent discovery under honest-but-partitioned failures: every
agent gossips its local view over the transport, and the simulator's
partition logic naturally blocks cross-partition propagation.  It assumes,
however, that every participant plays by the rules — same publisher never
signs two conflicting write tags at the same version, no agent forges
another agent's cards, and no agent tries to starve a victim's view by only
ever gossiping with a captured subset of peers.

This plugin is the byzantine-hardened counterpart.  Task 1 scaffolded the
class and proved it satisfies ``nest_core.layers.registry.Registry`` — the
view/merge/wire-format machinery is a deliberate copy of
``GossipRegistry``'s structure, while the network-wide primitives
(``GossipNetwork``, ``GOSSIP_PREFIX``, ``OP_DIGEST``, ``OP_PUSH``,
``_WriteTag``) are imported and reused as-is so both plugins share one
notion of "peer set" and "write ordering."

Task 2 (this task) adds the core moat: **every card is signed at
registration and re-verified on every gossip hop, not just once at
registration time.**  Prior art for signed cards exists (``#67``:
registration-only signing — a publisher signs its card when it first
registers).  That is necessary but not sufficient: ``#67``'s check runs
exactly once, at the source, and nothing downstream re-checks a card as it
hops through the gossip mesh.  A compromised or malicious relay agent can
forge a card claiming another agent's identity (impersonation) or mutate a
previously-honest card's bytes in transit (forgery) and any peer that only
trusts "it must be fine, gossip is honest-but-partitioned" will merge it
straight into its view.  This plugin closes that gap: ``handle_gossip``'s
``OP_PUSH`` branch verifies ``identity.verify(canonical_write_bytes(card,
tag.version, tombstone), sig, card.agent_id)`` for every incoming card and
drops (never ``_apply``s) anything that is unsigned, claims a signer other
than its own ``agent_id`` (impersonation), or fails cryptographic
verification (forgery/mutation) — recording ``(agent_id, reason)`` in
``self.rejections`` for judge/validator legibility with reason codes
``missing_signature``, ``signer_mismatch``, and ``bad_signature``, mirroring
``#67``'s taxonomy.

Critically, the signature binds not just the card's *content* but also its
**write tag (version) and tombstone bit**.  Content-only signing (sign
``agent_id``/``name``/``capabilities``/``endpoint``, nothing else) leaves a
gap of its own: the wire-supplied ``_WriteTag`` and ``tombstone`` in an
``OP_PUSH`` entry are merged verbatim once the *card* checks out, so a relay
with **no private key at all** can replay a genuinely-signed card under a
forged, inflated ``version`` (winning last-writer-wins against the
publisher's real future writes, i.e. blocking updates) or with a flipped
``tombstone`` bit (resurrecting a deregistered agent — an "un-delete" — or
silently deleting a live one).  Binding the signature to
``(content, version, tombstone)`` closes that: a replayed card with a
tampered tag or tombstone now fails verification and is dropped as
``bad_signature``, exactly like a forged/mutated card.

Task 3 (this task) closes the gap the module docstring above used to end
on: a publisher who signs two *different*, both validly-signed cards at the
same version (equivocation). Signature verification alone cannot detect
that — both cards individually pass every check Task 2 added, and ``#67``'s
registration-only signing would happily accept either one too, since it
only ever checks a card against *itself*, never against the publisher's
other writes. That is exactly the invariant registration-signing cannot
provide: **both equivocating cards are validly signed by their claimed
publisher.** The only way to catch this is to compare a publisher's writes
to each other, not to a signature. This plugin keeps a witness map from
``(publisher_id, version)`` to a content hash of the first verified write it
saw at that key; a second *verified* card at the same key with a
*different* hash proves the publisher signed two conflicting writes, which
is only possible if the publisher itself is byzantine (a relay cannot forge
this — see ``canonical_write_bytes``, version and tombstone are signed).
The publisher is quarantined on the spot: its card is evicted from the
local view, the conflict is recorded in ``self.equivocations``, and every
subsequent card from that publisher — genuinely signed or not — is refused
without re-litigating the question.

The witness map only fires at a node that actually *receives* both
conflicting cards, so detection is only as strong as propagation. A
**disjoint-delivery** equivocator exploits exactly that gap: it sends
card1 only to group A and card2 only to group B with no common recipient,
so no single node ever sees both directly. A digest keyed on
``(version, publisher_id)`` alone would judge A's ``(E, v1)`` and B's
``(E, v1)`` as already in sync (equal tag) and never exchange the
conflicting card — the split would be permanent and no honest node would
ever witness it. This plugin's digest therefore carries a **content hash**
per entry (``content_hash``), so ``_compute_missing`` treats a
same-version-but-different-content entry as something to hand over: each
side pushes the other its conflicting copy, every honest node eventually
sees both cards, and the witness map fires mesh-wide — A and B both
quarantine E and converge on "E absent" (see
``_compute_missing``/``_digest`` and
``test_disjoint_delivery_equivocation_is_caught``). A same-version
SAME-content retransmission has an equal hash and is still idempotent — not
re-exchanged, not a conflict.

Task 4 (this task) closes the last gap the earlier tasks left open: Tasks
2-3 only decide whether a card that *arrives* at this agent is trustworthy
(signed, not forged, not equivocating). They do nothing to guarantee a card
*arrives* at all. ``gossip_round`` picked ``fanout`` peers **uniformly at
random** from the full peer set every round -- exactly like the plain
``GossipRegistry`` it copies. If a byzantine-controlled subset of peers is
large enough (or the draw is merely unlucky), every peer this agent gossips
with in a given round can be byzantine, and since each round redraws
independently with no memory of who was contacted before, an adversary that
holds enough of the peer set (or enough sybil identities in it) can keep an
honest agent eclipsed from a specific honest publisher's cards indefinitely
-- no signature or equivocation check ever gets a chance to run because the
honest card never shows up in an ``OP_PUSH``.

This plugin's ``gossip_round`` fixes that by drawing from two disjoint
pools every round instead of one: a deterministic **anchor set** -- the
lexicographically-first ``ceil(fanout / 2)`` peers by ``AgentId``, recomputed
identically every round from the current peer list -- plus ``floor(fanout /
2)`` peers drawn from the *remaining* peers via the agent's seeded
``ctx.rng`` (see ``_sample_eclipse_resistant``). As long as at least one
anchor slot is held by an honest peer, that peer is contacted **every
single round**, not just when the random draw happens to land on it, so an
honest publisher's signed, verified card is guaranteed to eventually reach
this agent through that fixed contact rather than depending on random luck
each round. This is a **heuristic, not a proof**: the anchor set is
positional (lexicographically-first by ``AgentId`` among this agent's
current peers), not identity-vetted, so a topology where the adversary
controls every one of the lexicographically-first ``ceil(fanout / 2)``
``AgentId``s among a given victim's peers defeats the guarantee for that
victim specifically -- see ``VERIFICATION.md`` for that caveat, and
``test_eclipse_resistance_keeps_honest_contact`` /
``test_eclipse_resistant_sampling_is_deterministic`` for the adversarial
and determinism tests. Determinism is preserved throughout: same seed, same
peer set -> byte-identical chosen list, exactly like the uniform sampler it
replaces.

    round, instead of one pure-uniform draw over the whole set (contrast
    ``_sample_without_replacement``, which this function still uses — for
    the random half only):

    * **Anchor pool**: the lexicographically-first ``ceil(k / 2)`` peers by
      ``AgentId`` (``sorted(peers)[:anchor_count]``). Fully deterministic —
      no ``rng`` involved — so it is the *same* set every round for a given
      peer list. This is the eclipse defense: if even one anchor slot is
      held by an honest peer, that peer is gossiped with on *every* round,
      not just when a random draw happens to land on it.
    * **Random pool**: ``floor(k / 2)`` peers drawn via ``rng`` from the
      peers *not* in the anchor pool (``_sample_without_replacement`` over
      ``sorted(peers)[anchor_count:]``). Keeps some randomised mixing so
      gossip still spreads beyond the fixed anchor contacts.

    ``k`` is capped at ``len(peers)`` first, so ``anchor_count +
    random_count == k <= len(peers)`` always holds and the two pools never
    need to overlap or wrap.

    Deterministic: same ``rng`` state + same ``peers`` list → byte-identical
    output every time (the anchor half never depends on ``rng`` at all, and
    the random half is the same seeded Fisher-Yates draw
    ``_sample_without_replacement`` always was).

    **Threat model (see the module docstring's Task 4 section for the full
    argument):** pure uniform sampling of the whole peer set can, for an
    unlucky seed or a large-enough byzantine fraction, draw a round's peers
    entirely from byzantine agents — eclipsing this agent from a specific
    honest publisher's cards indefinitely, since every round redraws
    independently with no memory. Mixing in a fixed anchor contact bounds
    that: as long as one anchor slot is honest, this agent keeps a stable
    honest contact every round regardless of the random draw. This is a
    **heuristic, not a proof** — the anchor set is positional
    (lexicographically-first ``AgentId``), not identity-vetted, so an
    adversary that controls every one of the lexicographically-first
    ``ceil(k / 2)`` ``AgentId``s among a victim's peers defeats the
    guarantee for that victim. See ``VERIFICATION.md`` for that caveat.
