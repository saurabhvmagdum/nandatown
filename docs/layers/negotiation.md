# Negotiation layer

**What it does.** Bilateral bargaining: open a session, exchange
offers, respond, close with an `Agreement` (or `None` on breakdown).

## Interface

```python
class Negotiation(Protocol):
    async def open(self, partner: AgentId, terms: Terms) -> NegotiationSession: ...
    async def offer(self, session: NegotiationSession, terms: Terms) -> None: ...
    async def respond(self, session: NegotiationSession) -> NegotiationResponse: ...
    async def close(self, session: NegotiationSession) -> Agreement | None: ...
```

## Writing your own

See [`writing-a-plugin.md`](../writing-a-plugin.md). Register under
entry point group `nest.plugins.negotiation`.

Good fits to test here: multi-attribute negotiation, multi-party
negotiation, agenda-based bargaining, learning-based bidding.
