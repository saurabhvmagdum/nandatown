# Payments layer

**What it does.** Price a service, pay, verify a payment, refund.

## Interface

```python
class Payments(Protocol):
    async def quote(self, service: ServiceRef) -> Quote: ...
    async def pay(self, to: AgentId, amount: Money, ref: PaymentRef) -> Receipt: ...
    async def verify_payment(self, ref: PaymentRef) -> PaymentStatus: ...
    async def refund(self, ref: PaymentRef) -> None: ...
```

## Default plugin

`prepaid_credits` — in-memory debit/credit ledger. Constant-price
quotes, raises on insufficient balance, supports refund by `PaymentRef`.

Source: [`nest_plugins_reference/payments/prepaid_credits.py`](../../packages/nest-plugins-reference/nest_plugins_reference/payments/prepaid_credits.py).

## Writing your own

See [`writing-a-plugin.md`](../writing-a-plugin.md) — the full
walkthrough on that page builds a custom payments plugin end-to-end.
Register under entry point group `nest.plugins.payments`.

Good fits to test here: escrow, streaming payments, multi-party
settlement, on-chain stubs, x402-style HTTP payments.
