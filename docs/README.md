# NEST documentation

This folder is the long-form companion to the top-level
[README](../README.md). The README is the elevator pitch; these pages
go deeper.

## Start here

- **[quickstart.md](quickstart.md)** — Install, run a scenario,
  validate the trace. Five minutes, no clone required.
- **[concepts.md](concepts.md)** — The 12 layers, fidelity tiers,
  scenarios, plugins, traces, determinism.

## Build something

- **[writing-a-plugin.md](writing-a-plugin.md)** — End-to-end
  walkthrough: implement a `Payments` plugin, register it, swap it
  into a scenario, compare against the baseline.
- **[writing-a-scenario.md](writing-a-scenario.md)** — Full YAML
  schema with every field annotated, plus failure-injection knobs
  and a worked stress-test example.

## Layer reference

Each page lists the `Protocol` signature, the built-in default, and
where to look for inspiration.

## Going further

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** — Development setup
  (`uv sync`), code style, how to add a *built-in* scenario, CI
  checks.
- **[examples/](../examples/)** — Stub starting points for common
  plugin shapes.
